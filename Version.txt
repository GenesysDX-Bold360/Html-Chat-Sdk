        ##### Example Customization: Google Maps
        In this example customization we want to integrate with Google Maps. So, for an example, an operator sends a url link to google maps. When the client receives the chat message, a google map will nicely appear with a marker reference from the operator.

        How is this accomplished? We want to override the Viewmanager.addOrUpdateMessage method to parse the receiving operator message looking for certain keywords, such as '/map/' and '/@' for the latitude and longitude coordinates. Once we've confirmed the message contains those keywords, we instantiate a div for the google maps container and reference the google maps api. To understand more about how to work with the google maps api, please see [this simple tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/googleapi/).

        Included in the github repo is the code for how we've implemented this. It's under src/recipes/maps.
        To quickly get started, simply include the following two lines of code on your page:

        ```javascript
        <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="recipes/maps/bc-maps.css" />
        <script src="recipes/maps/bc-maps.js"></script>
        ```

    * Recipes Note:
        ** To use a recipe, copy the recipe from the src to the theme folder you are working in (if you are just using the individual themes)
        ** If you want the recipes to work on the popup, you must also include the file above on the popup.html under each theme.
